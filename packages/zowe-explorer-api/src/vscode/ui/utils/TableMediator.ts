/**
 * Mediator class for managing and accessing shared tables in Zowe Explorer.
 * Developers can expose their tables to allow external extenders to contribute to them.
 * This class serves to satisfy three main use cases:
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * ## Adding a table
 *
 * Tables are added to the mediator based on their unique ID using {@link TableMediator.addTable}. The ID is in the following format:
 *
 * `<TableName>-<8digit-Unique-Id>##<ExtensionId>`
 *
 * This avoids indirect naming conflicts by making the table identifier specific to the contributing extension.
 * The table ID can be accessed directly from a {@link Table.View} instance using the {@link Table.View.getId} function.
 *
 * ## Accessing a table
 *
 * Tables are only accessible by their unique IDs using {@link TableMediator.getTable}. Extenders must communicate a table ID
 * to another extender to facilitate table changes between extensions. This facilitates explicit access requests
 * by ensuring that two or more extenders are coordinating changes to the same table.
 *
 * The map containing the tables is not publicly exposed and is defined as a
 * [private class property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties)
 * to avoid exposing any tables to extenders who do not have explicit access.
 *
 * ## Removing a table
 *
 * Tables can only be removed by the extender that has contributed them using {@link TableMediator.deleteTable}.
 * This establishes a read-only relationship between the mediator and extenders that have not contributed the table they are trying to access.
 *
 * **Note** that this does not prevent an extender with access to the ID from disposing the table, once they've received access to the instance.
